There has been an increase in the number of applications that require large 
scale data analytics and one of the most popular approaches is MapReduce, which is a programming model and an associated
implementation for processing and generating large
data sets.
Users of this approach express the computation as
two functions : Map and Reduce.

 We implement the map part of MapReduce, showing that it can be improved by having the \textit{job tracker}`s functionalities implemented in a distributed manner, in opposition to the original implementation where this component is centralised.
